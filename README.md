# Welcome to GETIOM!

<a href="https://github.com/akrabi/GETIOM/">GETIOM</a> is an open source project for representing and analyzing Geo-Tagged information on Google Maps.
The project is based on <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> platform and other Open-Source algorithms.

The main goal of our project is to provide an easy framework in order to process & analyze Geo-Tagged information (Big Data) on the Google Map's platform - without the need to mess with servers and configurations. All you need to do is to provide a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST API</a> with a <a href="http://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a> collection (<a href="https://github.com/akrabi/GETIOM/wiki/Rest-API">Explained here</a>) and start using the app's flow even today!

## Full Documentation

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/akrabi/GETIOM/wiki) for full documentation, examples, operational details and other information.

## What does it do?

#### 1) An easy-to-use Geo-Tagged analyzing framework!

Stop wasting your time on configuring servers and settings. GETIOM handle's all the hard work for you! Simply run the server via Node.js and start analyzing your data. Frustration free!

#### 2) Filter your data!

No need to analyze all of your Big Data for nothing, Just use our unique map filters: Polygon, Circle & Rectangle - On your own map!

#### 3) Built in Popular Clustering Algorithms

GETIOM comes with built in Popular Clustering Algorithms such as: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">K-Means</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering">Hierarchical</a> & Grid (To be added later).

#### 4) Trend Detection!

GETIOM can analyze your data in your clusters, by simply clicking on a specific cluster - You can apply a Visualized trend detection alogrithms on your data.

#### 5) Use your own Algorithm!

GETIOM is extendable and let's you add your own Clustering Algorithms or Trend Detection Algorithms very easily!

## Build

To build:

```
$ git clone getiom
$ cd backend/
$ ./node app.js
```

## Dashboard

A dashboard for anazlyzing the clusters and trends will appear in the last step of the flow. 
More information can be found on the [ Wiki](https://github.com/akrabi/GETIOM/wiki).
